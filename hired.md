Nowadays, there are plenty of services to help you get a job. Even if they don't get you a job, they can still get you interviews which are the second best thing. The idea is that you create a profile, and Hired will auction you off to companies. The companies will offer you an exact salary (which you can of course negotiate on), if there is equity in the offer, and if they have employee benefits. Once a company makes you an offer, you can schedule a phone screen and/or interview.

The actual process involves creating a profile and passing an online coding challenge.

### The Coding Challenge

The coding challenge will consist of 3-5 questions where you need to devise an algorithmic solution in a finite amount of time in your chosen programming/scripting language. You are given a specified input file, and you need to return an output in a specific format. They will run your algorithm over test cases which you do not have access to; however, they will inform you if your algorithm passed, failed, or didn't complete the test case in enough time (fail). Generally speaking, an O(n^2) algorithm will pass most test cases, but may not pass them all in enough time. They might have been looking for an O(nlogn) solution.

**Do not worry about passing all of the test cases.** Even if you can't pass all of the tests, they may still let you in the auction. What's important is to answer as many questions as is required. There are some keys to success:

1. Practice your algorithms beforehand.

  You don't need to be a master of algorithms, but coming in rusty is a bad idea. It's good to practice O(n^2), O(nlogn), O(logn), and O(n) algorithms. There is a section of this book for that!    

1. Read the question, and plan your answer before writing it.

  This seems obvious, but many programmers think of a partial solution and start writing code immediately while solving the rest of the problem while they go. You don't have time to be making many mistakes, so a bit of planning may save you a ton of time.      

1. If you can't think of a solution, move on.

  Let your subconscious mull over the problem. By the time you are done answering a different problem, you might at least have an idea on how to approach the problem. Likewise, if it turns out that your solution doesn't work. Move on to the next problem. You can come back and rework your existing solution or think of a new one.  

1. DON'T PANIC

  It's harder to think if you're rushing. Stay calm. It's fine if you get stuck. Work through the solution that you came up with. Find out where you are in your algorithm and continue to the next step. If you're freezing at the beginning, then  just start writing part of the solution. The hardest part of any project is starting.      


### Your Profile

This section is just as important as your coding challenge. In fact, if you can't pass all of the tests, your profile is what will save you. There is a ton of boilerplate that you will need to fill out about skills and preferences, but what is most important is the "About Me" section. If two people do a mediocre job on the coding challenge, then the one with the engaging "About Me" will be let into the auction. The way I chose to structure mine was focus on what got me into programming, and then say what I'm looking for in my next opportunity. For some insight into what I did, I wanted to illistrate some key qualitys:

1. I'm a self learner, and I know where to go to for help
1. I enjoy teaching people what I know
1. I'm easy to work with, and I value the opinions of those around me
1. Company culture and the people are the best things you can offer me

This is by no means the only way to do this. Talking about hobbies and showing that you're more than just a resume will really help you. Hired.com will provide you with a 'talent advocate' which will help with this section, but they're only someone who will provide minor tweaks and suggestions. Spending a few days making sure your profile is top notch may be the difference that gets you into the program and bigger offers from companies.

### Other tips and tricks

 * The portfolio section is another opportunity for you to shine. Upload **pretty** pictures of your projects. I only have one picture of a project I made called [kitties.io](http://www.kitties.io), but it has great seed data, and I made sure my photo had some of the best seed data displayed. The truth is that project has a lot of issues, but from the photo you can't tell.

 * Part of the boilerplate is the minimum salary that you will accept. Don't be afraid to put a lower number down than you would like. The purpose of using this site isn't just to get a job, but to interview with multiple companies. The best way to get to get good at interviewing is to practice, and this website will **help** you.
  
 * References will help you more as a seasoned developer. If you are just starting out in tech, then this isn't a must, but a character reference will still help you. The recommendations section will help you.

 * Using a referral link of someone that got through the program may help you get in. **CITATION NEEDED**
